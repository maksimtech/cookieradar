"""The image runs a Python that still gets bug fixes, and the release SBOM of the
Python environment is resolved by that same interpreter.

Until 2026-11-13 the image was built on python:3.12-slim-trixie. 3.12 has had
security fixes only since April 2025, and 3.13 joined it in October 2026; 3.14
gets bug fixes until October 2027 and security fixes until October 2030
(peps.python.org release cycle, read on 2026-11-13). 3.15 had been out for a
month, too new for the wheels the image needs. exeradar and patchradar were
already built on 3.14.

sbom.yml describes the Python environment of a release with the interpreter it
sets up. On another minor version pip can resolve other wheels and markers, and
the two SBOMs attached to the release would describe two different resolutions.
